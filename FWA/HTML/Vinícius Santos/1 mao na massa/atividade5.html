    <h1>Lil Peep</h1>
    <P>Wait right here<br>
        I'll be back in the mornin'<br>
        I know that I'm not that important to you<br>
        But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous (yeah)</P>
        <P>So much more than perfect (yeah)<br>
            Right now I know that I'm not really worth it<br>
            If you give me time, I could work on it<br>
            Give me some time while I work on it</P>
        <p>Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you<br>
            The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me (yeah)<br>
            Look at my face when I fuck on your waist<br>
            'Cause we only have one conversation a week</p> 
        <p>That's why your friends always hatin' on me<br>
            Fuck 'em though, no I did this all by myself<br>
            Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help<br>
            And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings</p>
        <p>None of my exes is over Lil Peep<br>
            Nobody flexin' as much as I be<br>
            That's why she text me and tell me she love me<br>
            She know that someday I'll be over the sea</p> 
        <P>Makin' my money and smokin' my weed<br>
            I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me<br>
            Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me<br>
            I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be</P> 
        <p>If I find a way, would you walk it with me?<br>
            Look at my face while you talkin' to me<br>
            'Cause we only have one conversation a week</p> 
        <p>Can I get one conversation at least?<br>
            Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach<br>
            This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces</p>
        <p>Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason<br>
            A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces<br>
            Look at the sky tonight, all of those stars have a reason
            </p>

<h1>Mrs. Potato Head</h1>
<h2>Melanie Martinez</h2>
<p>If you weren't born with it<br>
    You can buy a couple ornaments<br>
    Just be sure to read the warning, kids<br>
    'Cause pretty soon you'll be bored of it<br>
    Sexual, hey girl if you wanna feel sexual<br>
    You can always call up a professional<br>
    They stick pins in you like a vegetable</p><br><br>
<p>Kids forever, kids forever<br>
    Baby soft skin turns into leather<br>
    Don't be dramatic it's only some plastic<br>
    No one will love you if you're unattractive</p><br><br>
    <p>Oh Mrs. Potato Head tell me<br>
        Is it true that pain is beauty?<br>
        Does a new face come with a warranty?<br>
        Will a pretty face make it better?<br>
        Oh Mr. Potato Head tell me<br>
        How did you afford her surgery?<br>
        Do you swear you'll stay forever<br>
        Even if her face don't stay together<br>
        Even if her face don't stay together</p><br><br>
    <P>If you want a little more confidence<br>
    Potatoes turn to french fries, yeah it's common sense<br>
    All you need's a couple more condiments<br>
    And a hundred thousand dollars for some compliments<br>
    It's such a waste<br>
    When little girls grow into their mother's face<br>
    But little girls are learning how to cut and paste<br>
    And pucker up their lips until they suffocate</P><br><br>
<p>Kids forever kids forever<br><br>
Baby soft skin turns into leather<br>
Don't be dramatic it's only some plastic<br>
No one will love you if you're unattractive</p><br><br>
<p>Oh Mrs. Potato Head tell me<br>
Is it true that pain is beauty?<br>
Does a new face come with a warranty?<br>
Will a pretty face make it better?<br>
Oh Mr. potato head tell me<br>
How did you afford her surgery?<br>
Do you swear you'll stay forever<br>
Even if her face don't stay together<br>
Stay forever, stay forever<br>
Even if her face don't stay together<br>
Stay forever, stay forever<br>
Even if her face don't stay together</p><br><br>
<p>Oh Mrs. Potato Head tell me<br>

Even if her face don't stay together<br>
Stay forever, stay forever<br>
Even if her face don't stay together<br>
Stay forever, stay forever<br>
Even if her face don't stay together<br>
Stay forever, stay forever<br>
Even if her face don't stay together<br>

   <h1> Paparazzi</h1>
<h2>Canção de Kim Dracula</h2>


   <p> We are the crowd<br>
We're c-coming out<br>
Got my flash on, it's true<br>
Need that picture of you<br>
It's so magical<br>
We'd be so fantastical<br>
Yeah, yea-yeah<br>
Leather and jeans<br>
Garage glamorous<br>
Not sure what it means<br>
But this photo of us, it don't have a price<br>
Ready for those flashing lights<br>
'Cause you know that, baby, I<br>
I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me<br>
Papa-paparazzi<br>
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be<br>
Your papa-paparazzi<br>
Promise I'll be kind<br>
But I won't stop until that boy is mine<br>
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me<br>
Papa-paparazzi<br>
I think you should know that I see other people and they see me looking back<br>
Baby, don't you break my heart I told you that it's made of glass<br>
I'ma make it fast, step it up, I'll step my foot on the gas<br>
Look at the past blast, I'ma make you fall on your ass<br>
Suck it up and pacify, but it's irrelevant<br>
Y'all motherfuckers do it for the hell of it<br>
Say you care if I cry, you lie<br>
If I put 'em side by side, you sigh<br>
(Ah) care if I cry, you lie<br>
If I put 'em side by side, you die<br>
(Ah) care if I cry, you lie<br>
If I put 'em side by side, side by side<br>
I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me<br>
Papa-paparazzi<br>
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be<br>
Your papa-paparazzi<br>
Promise I'll be kind<br>
But I won't stop until that boy is mine<br>
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me<br>
Papa-paparazzi</p><br>

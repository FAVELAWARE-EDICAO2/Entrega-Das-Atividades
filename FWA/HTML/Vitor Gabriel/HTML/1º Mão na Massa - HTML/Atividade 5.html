        Somebody once told me <br>
The world is gonna roll me <br>
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed <br>
She was looking kind of dumb <br>
With her finger and her thumb <br>
In the shape of an L on her forehead <br>
    </p> <h4>
    <p>
        Well, the years start coming <br>
And they don't stop coming <br>
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running <br>
Didn't make sense not to live for fun <br>
Your brain gets smart <br>
But your head gets dumb <br>
    </p>
    <p>So much to do, so much to see <br>
        So what's wrong with taking the back streets? <br>
        You'll never know if you don't go <br>
        You'll never shine if you don't glow <br>
    </p>
    <p>Hey now, you're an all star <br>
        Get your game on, go play <br>
        Hey now, you're a rock star <br>
        Get the show on, get paid <br>
        And all that glitters is gold <br>
        Only shooting stars break the mold <br>
    </p>
<p>It's a cool place and they say it gets colder <br>
    You're bundled up now <br>
    But wait till you get older <br>
    But the meteor men beg to differ <br>
    Judging by the hole in the satellite picture <br></p>

<p>The ice we skate is getting pretty thin <br>
    The water is getting warm <br>
    So you might as well swim <br>
    My world's on fire, how about yours? <br>
    That's the way I like it <br>
    And I never get bored <br></p>

<p>Hey now, you're an all star <br>
    Get your game on, go play <br>
    Hey now, you're a rock star <br>
    Get the show on, get paid <br>
    And all that glitters is gold <br>
    Only shooting stars break the mold <br></p>

<p>Hey now, you're an all star <br>
    Get your game on, go play <br>
    Hey now, you're a rock star <br>
    Get the show on, get paid <br>
    And all that glitters is gold <br>
    Only shooting stars <br></p>

<p>Somebody once asked <br>
    Could I spare some change for gas? <br>
    I need to get myself away from this place <br>
    I said: Yep, what a concept <br>
    I could use a little fuel myself <br>
    And we could all use a little change <br></p>

<p>Well the years start coming <br>
    And they don't stop coming <br>
    Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running <br>
    Didn't make sense not to live for fun <br>
    Your brain gets smart <br>
    But your head gets dumb <br></p>

<p>So much to do, so much to see <br>
    So what's wrong with taking the back streets <br>
    You'll never know if you don't go (go!) <br>
    You'll never shine if you don't glow <br></p>

<p>Hey now, you're an all star <br>
    Get your game on, go play <br>
    Hey now, you're a rock star <br>
    Get the show on, get paid <br></p>

<p>And all that glitters is gold <br>
    Only shooting stars break the mold <br>
    And all that glitters is gold <br>
    Only shooting stars break the mold <br></p>

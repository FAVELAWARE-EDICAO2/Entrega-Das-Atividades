        <h2>Wrecked(Imagine Dragons) -Por Allam</h2>
        <p>
            Days pass by and my eyes stay dry, and I think that I'm okay <br>
            'Til I find myself in conversation, fading away <br>
            The way you smile, the way you walk <br>
            The time you took to teach me all that you had taught <br>
            Tell me, how am I supposed to move on? <br>
            These days I'm becoming everything that I hate <br>
            Wishing you were around but now it's too late <br>
            My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost <br>
            Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away <br>
            One more rainy day without you <br>
            Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day <br>
            One more rainy day <br>
            Oh, I'm a wreck without you here <br>
            Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone <br>
            I've tried to put this all behind me <br>
            I think I was wrecked all along <br>
            Yeah, I'm a wreck <br>
            They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away <br>
            But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves <br>
            Way you laugh when your shoulders shook <br>
            The time you took to teach me all that you had taught <br>
            Tell me, how am I supposed to move on? <br>
            These days I'm becoming everything that I hate <br>
            Wishing you were around but now it's too late <br>
            My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost <br>
            Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away <br>
            One more rainy day without you <br>
            Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day <br>
            One more rainy day <br>
            Oh, I'm a wreck without you here <br>
            Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone <br>
            I've tried to put this all behind me <br>
            I think I was wrecked all along <br>
            These days when I'm on the brink of the edge <br>
            Remember the words that you said <br>
            Remember the life you led <br>
            You'd say, "Oh, suck it all up, don't get stuck in the mud <br>
            Thinkin' of things that you should have done" <br>
            I'll see you again, my loved one <br>
            I'll see you again, my loved one <br>
            Yeah, I'm a wreck <br>
            I'll see you again, my loved one <br>
            Yeah, I'm a wreck without you here (loved one) <br>
            Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone (I'm a wreck since you've been gone) <br>
            I've tried to put this all behind me <br>
            I think I was wrecked all along (I'm a wreck) <br>
            Yeah, I'm a wreck <br>
            Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away but I can't <br>
            One more rainy day without you (one more rainy day) <br>
            Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day but I can't <br>
            One more rainy day <br>

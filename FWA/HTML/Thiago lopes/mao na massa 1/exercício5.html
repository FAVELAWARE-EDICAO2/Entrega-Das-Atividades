    <h1>Stressed out</h1>
    <h3>Twenty One Pilots</h3>
    <p>
        I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard <br>
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words <br>
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new <br>
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang <br>
I was told when I get older, all my fears would shrink <br>
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think <br>
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think <br>
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think <br>
Wish we could turn back time <br>
To the good old days <br>
When our mama sang us to sleep <br>
But now we're stressed out (oh) <br>
Wish we could turn back time (oh) <br>
To the good old days (oh) <br>
When our mama sang us to sleep <br>
But now we're stressed out <br>
We're stressed out <br>
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young <br>
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from? <br>
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it <br>
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one <br>
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose <br>
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam <br>
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered <br>
Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter <br>
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think <br>
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think <br>
Wish we could turn back time <br>
To the good old days <br>
When our mama sang us to sleep <br>
But now we're stressed out (oh) <br>
Wish we could turn back time (oh) <br>
To the good old days (oh) <br>
When our mama sang us to sleep <br>
But now we're stressed out <br>
Used to play pretend, give each other different names <br>
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away <br>
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face saying <br>
"Wake up, you need to make money", yeah <br>
We used to play pretend, give each other different names <br>
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away <br>
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face saying <br>
"Wake up, you need to make money", yeah <br>
Wish we could turn back time <br>
To the good old days <br>
When our mama sang us to sleep <br>
But now we're stressed out (oh) <br>
Wish we could turn back time (oh) <br>
To the good old days (oh) <br>
When our mama sang us to sleep <br>
But now we're stressed out <br>
We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money <br>
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money <br>
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money <br>
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money <br>
Used to play pretend, give each other different names <br>
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away <br>
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face saying <br>
"Wake up, you need to make money", yeah <br>
